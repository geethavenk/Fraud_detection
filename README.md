# Fraud detection in online transactions

The rapid growth of online transactions has brought convenience to consumers and businesses alike, but it has also led to a significant rise in fraudulent activities. The increasing sophistication of fraud attempts, including stolen credit card usage, identity theft, and phishing scams, poses substantial risks to the integrity and security of online financial systems. As a result, detecting and preventing fraud in online transactions has become both critical and challenging.

Despite continuous efforts and the implementation of various security measures, online fraud remains a major issue, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in digital commerce. The vast volume of online transactions and the evolving tactics of fraudsters make it difficult to identify fraudulent activities swiftly and accurately. This project is dedicated to developing advanced fraud detection solutions specifically tailored for online transactions.
